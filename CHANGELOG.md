# Changelog

## [5.7.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- ✅ **OpenCode Zen Go plan support** (`zgo@`, `zengo@` shortcuts) — routes to `zen/go/v1/` subscription endpoint
  - `zgo@glm-5` — GLM-5 via go subscription (free/included in plan)
  - Dynamic model discovery: probes the go endpoint at model selector load time to surface available models
- ✅ **OpenCode Zen free model live cross-reference** — `fetchZenFreeModels()` now validates against the live `/zen/v1/models` endpoint, eliminating stale models.dev entries (e.g. `kimi-k2.5-free` which no longer exists)

### Fixed
- 🐛 **OpenCode Zen auth** — `zen@` models were sending empty `Authorization` header, causing 401 errors. Now correctly sends `OPENCODE_API_KEY` (falls back to `Bearer public` for anonymous free model access without a key)
- 🐛 **Misleading "Check API key" error** — `getRecoveryHint()` now detects when a 401 is caused by an unsupported model name (not a bad API key) and returns the correct hint
- 🐛 **Zen Go model probe false positives** — Previous probe logic misidentified Kimi/MiniMax as go-plan models because their non-standard error format bypassed the `ModelError` check. Now only includes models that return actual completion choices

### Usage
```bash
# Free anonymous models (no key required)
claudish --model zen@gpt-5-nano "task"
claudish --model zen@big-pickle "task"

# OpenCode Go plan (requires OPENCODE_API_KEY)
claudish --model zgo@glm-5 "task"
```

## [2.3.1] - 2025-11-25

### Fixed
- 🐛 **Prevent Client Crash with Gemini Thinking Blocks** - Fixed an issue where Gemini 3's raw thinking blocks caused Claude Code (client) to crash with `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'R.map')`.
  - Thinking blocks are now safely wrapped in XML `<thinking>` tags within standard Text blocks.
  - Added integration tests to prevent regression.

## [2.3.0] - 2025-11-24

### Added
- ✅ **Fuzzy Search for Models** - New `--search` (or `-s`) flag to find models
  - Search across 300+ OpenRouter models by name, ID, or description
  - Intelligent fuzzy matching (handles typos, partial matches, and abbreviations)
  - Displays rich metadata: Provider, Pricing, Context Window, and Relevance Score
  - Caches full model list locally for performance (auto-updates every 2 days)
- ✅ **Expanded Model Support** - Added latest high-performance models:
  - `google/gemini-3-pro-preview` (1M context, reasoning, vision)
  - `openai/gpt-5.1-codex` (400K context, optimized for coding)

### Changed
- **Unavailable Model Handling** - Automatically skips models that are no longer returned by the API (e.g., discontinued models) instead of showing placeholders
- **Updated Recommended List** - Refreshed the top development models list with latest rankings

### Example Usage
```bash
# Search for specific models
claudish --search "Gemini"
claudish -s "llama 3"

# Force update the local model cache
claudish --search "gpt-5" --force-update
```

## [2.2.1]

### Added
- ✅ **JSON Output for Model List** - `--list-models --json` returns machine-readable JSON
  - Enables programmatic access to model metadata
  - Returns complete model information: id, name, description, provider, category, priority, pricing, context
  - Clean JSON output (no extra logging) for easy parsing
  - Order-independent flags: `--list-models --json` OR `--json --list-models`
  - Supports integration with Claude Code commands for dynamic model selection

### Changed
- Enhanced `--list-models` command with optional JSON output format
- Updated help text to document new `--list-models --json` option

### Technical Details
- New function: `printAvailableModelsJSON()` in `src/cli.ts`
- Reads from `recommended-models.json` and outputs complete structure
- Preserves all existing text mode behavior (zero regression)
- Graceful fallback to runtime-generated model info if JSON file unavailable

### Benefits
- **Dynamic Integration** - Claude Code commands can query Claudish for latest model recommendations
- **Single Source of Truth** - Claudish owns the model list, commands query it dynamically
- **No Manual Updates** - Commands always get fresh model data from Claudish
- **Programmatic Access** - Easy to parse with `jq` or JSON parsers
- **Future-Proof** - JSON API enables integration with other tools

### Example Usage
```bash
# Text output (existing behavior)
claudish --list-models

# JSON output (new feature)
claudish --list-models --json

# Parse with jq
claudish --list-models --json | jq '.models[0].id'
# Output: x-ai/grok-code-fast-1

# Count models
claudish --list-models --json | jq '.models | length'
# Output: 7
```

## [1.5.0] - 2025-11-16

### Added
- ✅ **Curated Model List** - Claudish uses a curated list of recommended models
  - `--list-models` command shows all recommended models
  - Models are maintained in `src/config.ts` and `src/types.ts`
  - Added 4 new models:
    - `google/gemini-2.5-flash` - Advanced reasoning with built-in thinking
    - `google/gemini-2.5-pro` - State-of-the-art reasoning
    - `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001` - Faster TTFT, multimodal
    - `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` - Ultra-low latency
    - `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324` - 685B parameter MoE

### Changed
- **Build Process** - Now runs `extract-models` script before building
  - Generates `src/config.ts` from shared model list
  - Generates `src/types.ts` with model IDs
  - Auto-generated files include warning headers

### Technical Details
- Script: `scripts/extract-models.ts` - Generates TypeScript from markdown (maintainers only)
- Maintains provider, priority, name, and description metadata

---

## [1.4.1] - 2025-11-16

### Fixed
- ✅ **npm Installation Error** - Removed leftover `install` script that tried to build from source during `npm install`
  - The package is now pre-built and ready to use
  - No more "FileNotFound opening root directory 'src'" errors
  - Users can now successfully install with `npm install -g claudish@latest`
- ✅ **Misleading Bun Requirement Warning** - Removed incorrect warning about needing Bun runtime
  - Claudish runs perfectly with **Node.js only** (no Bun required!)
  - The built binary uses `#!/usr/bin/env node` and Node.js dependencies
  - Postinstall now shows helpful usage examples instead of false warnings

### Technical Details
- Removed: `"install": "bun run build && bun link"` script that required source files
- Simplified: `postinstall` script now just shows usage instructions (no runtime checks)
- Package includes pre-built `dist/index.js` (142 KB) that runs with Node.js 18+
- No source files needed in npm package
- **Clarification**: Bun is only needed for **development** (building from source), not for **using** the tool

---

## [1.4.0] - 2025-11-15

### Added
- ✅ **Claude Code Standard Environment Variables Support**
  - Added `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` environment variable for model selection (Claude Code standard)
  - Added `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL` environment variable (auto-set by Claudish)
  - Both variables properly set when running Claude Code for UI display consistency

### Changed
- **Model Selection Priority Order**:
  1. CLI `--model` flag (highest priority)
  2. `CLAUDISH_MODEL` environment variable (Claudish-specific)
  3. `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` environment variable (Claude Code standard, new fallback)
  4. Interactive prompt (if none set)
- Updated help text to document new environment variables
- Updated `--list-models` output to show both `CLAUDISH_MODEL` and `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` options

### Benefits
- **Better Integration**: Seamless compatibility with Claude Code's standard environment variables
- **Flexible Configuration**: Three ways to set model (CLI flag, CLAUDISH_MODEL, ANTHROPIC_MODEL)
- **UI Consistency**: Model names properly displayed in Claude Code UI status line
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing usage patterns continue to work

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Option 1: Claudish-specific (takes priority)
export CLAUDISH_MODEL=x-ai/grok-code-fast-1

# Option 2: Claude Code standard (new fallback)
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL=x-ai/grok-code-fast-1

# Option 3: CLI flag (overrides all)
claudish --model x-ai/grok-code-fast-1
```

### Technical Details
- Environment variables set in `claude-runner.ts` for Claude Code:
  - `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` = selected OpenRouter model
  - `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL` = same model (consistent experience)
  - `CLAUDISH_ACTIVE_MODEL_NAME` = model display name (status line)
- Priority order implemented in `cli.ts` argument parser
- Build size: ~142 KB (unminified for performance)

---

## [1.3.1] - 2025-11-13

### Fixed

#### `--stdin` Mode
- **BUG FIX**: `--stdin` mode no longer triggers interactive Ink UI
  - Fixed logic in `cli.ts` to check `!config.stdin` when determining interactive mode
  - Previously: Empty `claudeArgs` + `--stdin` → triggered interactive mode → Ink error
  - Now: `--stdin` correctly uses single-shot mode regardless of `claudeArgs`
  - Resolves "Raw mode is not supported on the current process.stdin" errors when piping input

#### ANTHROPIC_API_KEY Requirement
- **BUG FIX**: Removed premature `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` validation in CLI parser
  - `claude-runner.ts` automatically sets placeholder if not provided (line 138)
  - Users only need to set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for single-variable setup
  - Cleaner UX - users don't need to understand placeholder concept
  - Error message clarified: Only asks for `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

### Removed
- **Cleanup**: Removed unused `@types/react` dependency
  - Leftover from when Ink was used (already replaced with readline in v1.2.0)
  - No functional change - code already doesn't use React/Ink

### Changed
- **Documentation**: Simplified setup instructions
  - Users only need `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` handled automatically by Claudish

## [1.3.0] - 2025-11-12

### 🎉 Major: Cross-Platform Compatibility

**Universal Runtime Support**: Claudish now works with **both Node.js and Bun!**

#### What Changed

**Architecture Refactor:**
- ✅ Replaced `Bun.serve()` with `@hono/node-server` (works on both runtimes)
- ✅ Replaced `Bun.spawn()` with Node.js `child_process.spawn()` (cross-platform)
- ✅ Changed shebang from `#!/usr/bin/env bun` to `#!/usr/bin/env node`
- ✅ Updated build target from `--target bun` to `--target node`
- ✅ Added `@hono/node-server` dependency for universal server compatibility

**Package Updates:**
- ✅ Added engine requirement: `node: ">=18.0.0"`
- ✅ Maintained Bun support: `bun: ">=1.0.0"`
- ✅ Both runtimes fully supported and tested

### ✨ Feature: Interactive API Key Prompt

**Easier Onboarding**: API key now prompted interactively when missing!

#### What Changed

**User Experience Improvements:**
- ✅ Interactive mode now prompts for OpenRouter API key if not set in environment
- ✅ Similar UX to model selector - clean, simple readline-based prompt
- ✅ Validates API key format (warns if doesn't start with `sk-or-v1-`)
- ✅ Session-only usage - not saved to disk for security
- ✅ Non-interactive mode still requires env variable (fails fast with clear error)

**Implementation:**
- Added `promptForApiKey()` function in `src/simple-selector.ts`
- Updated `src/cli.ts` to allow missing API key in interactive mode
- Updated `src/index.ts` to prompt before model selection
- Proper stdin cleanup to avoid interference with Claude Code

#### Benefits

**For New Users:**
- 🎯 **Zero setup for first try** - Just run `claudish` and paste API key when prompted
- 🎯 **No env var hunting** - Don't need to know how to set environment variables
- 🎯 **Instant feedback** - See if API key works immediately

**For Everyone:**
- 🎯 **Better security** - Can use temporary keys without saving to env
- 🎯 **Multi-account switching** - Easy to try different API keys
- 🎯 **Consistent UX** - Similar to model selector prompt

#### Usage

```bash
# Before (required env var):
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
claudish

# After (optional env var):
claudish  # Will prompt: "Enter your OpenRouter API key:"
# Paste key, press Enter, done!

# Still works with env var (no prompt):
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
claudish  # Skips prompt, uses env var
```

#### Benefits

**For Users:**
- 🎯 **Use with npx** - No installation required! `npx claudish@latest "prompt"`
- 🎯 **Use with bunx** - Also works! `bunx claudish@latest "prompt"`
- 🎯 **Install with npm** - Standard Node.js install: `npm install -g claudish`
- 🎯 **Install with bun** - Faster alternative: `bun install -g claudish`
- 🎯 **Universal compatibility** - Works everywhere Node.js 18+ runs
- 🎯 **No Bun required** - But Bun still works (and is faster!)

**Technical:**
- ✅ **Single codebase** - No runtime-specific branches
- ✅ **Same performance** - Both runtimes deliver full functionality
- ✅ **Zero breaking changes** - All existing usage patterns work
- ✅ **Production tested** - Verified with both `node` and `bun` execution

#### Migration Guide

**No changes needed!** All existing usage works identically:

```bash
# All of these work in v1.3.0:
claudish "prompt"                                    # Works with node or bun
npx claudish@latest "prompt"                         # NEW: npx support
bunx claudish@latest "prompt"                        # NEW: bunx support
node dist/index.js "prompt"                          # Direct node execution
bun dist/index.js "prompt"                           # Direct bun execution
```

#### Technical Implementation

**Server:**
```typescript
// Before (Bun-only):
const server = Bun.serve({ port, fetch: app.fetch });

// After (Universal):
import { serve } from '@hono/node-server';
const server = serve({ fetch: app.fetch, port });
```

**Process Spawning:**
```typescript
// Before (Bun-only):
const proc = Bun.spawn(["claude", ...args], { ... });
await proc.exited;

// After (Universal):
import { spawn } from 'node:child_process';
const proc = spawn("claude", args, { ... });
await new Promise((resolve) => proc.on("exit", resolve));
```

#### Verification

Tested and working:
- ✅ `npx claudish@latest --help` (Node.js)
- ✅ `bunx claudish@latest --help` (Bun)
- ✅ `node dist/index.js --help`
- ✅ `bun dist/index.js --help`
- ✅ Interactive mode with model selector
- ✅ Single-shot mode with prompts
- ✅ Proxy server functionality
- ✅ All flags and options

## [1.2.1] - 2025-11-11

### Fixed
- 🔥 **CRITICAL**: Fixed readline stdin cleanup timing issue
  - **Issue**: Even with readline removed, stdin interference persisted when selecting model interactively
  - **Root cause**: Promise was resolving BEFORE readline fully cleaned up stdin listeners
  - **Technical problem**:
    1. User selects model → `rl.close()` called
    2. Promise resolved immediately (before close event completed)
    3. Claude Code spawned with `stdin: "inherit"`
    4. Readline's lingering listeners interfered with Claude Code's stdin
    5. Result: Typing lag and missed keystrokes
  - **Solution**:
    1. Store selection in variable
    2. Only resolve Promise in close event handler
    3. Explicitly remove ALL stdin listeners (`data`, `end`, `error`, `readable`)
    4. Pause stdin to stop event processing
    5. Ensure not in raw mode
    6. Add 200ms delay before resolving to guarantee complete cleanup
  - **Result**: Zero stdin interference, smooth typing in Claude Code

### Technical Details
```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE: Resolved immediately after close()
rl.on("line", (input) => {
  const model = getModel(input);
  rl.close();  // Asynchronous!
  resolve(model);  // Resolved too early!
});

// ✅ AFTER: Resolve only after close completes
let selectedModel = null;
rl.on("line", (input) => {
  selectedModel = getModel(input);
  rl.close();  // Trigger close event
});
rl.on("close", () => {
  // Aggressive cleanup
  process.stdin.pause();
  process.stdin.removeAllListeners("data");
  // ... remove all listeners ...
  setTimeout(() => resolve(selectedModel), 200);
});
```

### Verification
```bash
claudish  # Interactive mode
# → Select model
# → Should be SMOOTH now!
```

---

## [1.2.0] - 2025-11-11

### Changed
- 🔥 **MAJOR**: Completely removed Ink/React UI for model selection
  - **Root cause**: Ink UI was interfering with Claude Code's stdin even after unmount
  - **Previous attempts**: Tried `unmount()`, `setRawMode(false)`, `pause()`, `waitUntilExit()` - none worked
  - **Real solution**: Replace Ink with simple readline-based selector
  - **Result**: Zero stdin interference, completely separate from Claude Code process

### Technical Details
**Why Ink was the problem:**
1. Ink uses React components that set up complex stdin event listeners
2. Even with proper unmount/cleanup, internal React state and event emitters persisted
3. These lingering listeners interfered with Claude Code's stdin handling
4. Result: Typing lag, missed keystrokes in interactive mode

**The fix:**
- Replaced `src/interactive-cli.tsx` (Ink/React) with `src/simple-selector.ts` (readline)
- Removed dependencies: `ink`, `react` (300KB+ saved)
- Simple readline interface with `terminal: false` flag
- Explicit `removeAllListeners()` on close
- No React components, no complex event handling

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Zero stdin interference
- ✅ Lighter build (no React/Ink overhead)
- ✅ Simpler, more reliable
- ✅ Faster startup
- ✅ Same performance in both interactive and direct modes

### Breaking Changes
- Model selector UI is now simple numbered list (no fancy interactive UI)
- This is intentional for reliability and performance

### Verification
```bash
# Both modes should now have identical performance:
claudish --model x-ai/grok-code-fast-1  # Direct
claudish  # Interactive → select number → SMOOTH!
```

---

## [1.1.6] - 2025-11-11

### Fixed
- 🔥 **CRITICAL FIX**: Ink UI stdin cleanup causing typing lag in interactive mode
  - **Root cause**: Interactive model selector (Ink UI) was not properly cleaning up stdin listeners
  - **Symptoms**:
    - `claudish --model x-ai/grok-code-fast-1` (direct) → No lag ✅
    - `claudish` → select model from UI → Severe lag ❌
  - **Technical issue**: Ink's `useInput` hook was setting up stdin event listeners that interfered with Claude Code's stdin handling
  - **Solution**:
    1. Explicitly restore stdin state after Ink unmount (`setRawMode(false)` + `pause()`)
    2. Added 100ms delay to ensure Ink fully cleans up before spawning Claude Code
  - **Result**: Interactive mode now has same performance as direct model selection

### Technical Details
The issue occurred because:
1. Ink UI renders and sets `process.stdin.setRawMode(true)` to capture keyboard input
2. User selects model, Ink calls `unmount()` and `exit()`
3. But stdin listeners were not immediately removed
4. Claude Code spawns and tries to use stdin
5. Conflict between Ink's lingering listeners and Claude Code's stdin = typing lag

The fix ensures:
```typescript
// After Ink unmount:
if (process.stdin.setRawMode) {
  process.stdin.setRawMode(false);  // Restore normal mode
}
if (!process.stdin.isPaused()) {
  process.stdin.pause();  // Stop listening
}
// Wait 100ms for full cleanup
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
```

### Verification
```bash
# Both modes should now be smooth:
claudish --model x-ai/grok-code-fast-1  # Direct (always worked)
claudish  # Interactive UI → select model (NOW FIXED!)
```

---

## [1.1.5] - 2025-11-11

### Fixed
- 🔥 **CRITICAL PERFORMANCE FIX**: Removed minification from build process
  - **Root cause**: Minified build was 10x slower than source code
  - **Evidence**: `bun run dev:grok` (source) was fast, but `claudish` (minified build) was laggy
  - **Solution**: Disabled `--minify` flag in build command
  - **Impact**: Built version now has same performance as source version
  - **Build size**: 127 KB (was 60 KB) - worth it for 10x performance gain
  - **Result**: Typing in Claude Code is now smooth and responsive with built version

### Technical Analysis
The Bun minifier was causing performance degradation in the proxy hot path:
- Minified code: 868+ function calls per session had overhead from minification artifacts
- Unminified code: Same 868+ calls but with optimal Bun JIT compilation
- The minifier was likely interfering with Bun's runtime optimizations
- Streaming operations particularly affected by minification

### Verification
```bash
# Before (minified): Laggy, missing keystrokes
claudish --model x-ai/grok-code-fast-1

# After (unminified): Smooth, responsive
claudish --model x-ai/grok-code-fast-1  # Same performance as dev mode
```

---

## [1.1.4] - 2025-11-11

### Changed
- **Bun Runtime Required**: Explicitly require Bun runtime for optimal performance
  - Updated `engines` in package.json: `"bun": ">=1.0.0"`
  - Removed Node.js from engines (Node.js is 10x slower for proxy operations)
  - Added postinstall script to check for Bun installation
  - Updated README with clear Bun requirement and installation instructions
  - Built files already use `#!/usr/bin/env bun` shebang

### Added
- Postinstall check for Bun runtime with helpful installation instructions
- `preferGlobal: true` in package.json for better global installation UX
- Documentation about why Bun is required (performance benefits)

### Installation
```bash
# Recommended: Use bunx (always uses Bun)
bunx claudish --version

# Or install globally (requires Bun in PATH)
npm install -g claudish
```

### Why This Matters
- **Performance**: Bun is 10x faster than Node.js for proxy I/O operations
- **Responsiveness**: Eliminates typing lag in Claude Code
- **Native**: Claudish is built with Bun, not a Node.js compatibility layer

---

## [1.1.3] - 2025-11-11

### Fixed
- 🔥 **CRITICAL PERFORMANCE FIX**: Eliminated all logging overhead when debug mode disabled
  - Guarded all logging calls with `isLoggingEnabled()` checks in hot path
  - **Zero CPU overhead** from logging when debug disabled (previously: function calls + object creation still happened)
  - Fixed 868+ function calls per session that were executing even when logging disabled
  - Root cause: `logStructured()` and `log()` were called everywhere, creating objects and evaluating parameters before checking if logging was enabled
  - Solution: Check `isLoggingEnabled()` BEFORE calling logging functions and creating log objects
  - **Performance impact**: Eliminates all logging-related CPU overhead in production (no debug mode)
  - Affected hot path locations:
    - `sendSSE()` function (called 868+ times for thinking_delta events)
    - Thinking Delta logging (868 calls)
    - Content Delta logging (hundreds of calls)
    - Tool Argument Delta logging (many calls per tool)
    - All error handling and state transition logging
  - **Result**: Typing in Claude Code should now be smooth and responsive even with claudish running

### Technical Details
```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (overhead even when disabled):
logStructured("Thinking Delta", {
  thinking: reasoningText,  // Object created
  blockIndex: reasoningBlockIndex
});  // Function called, enters, checks logFilePath, returns

// ✅ AFTER (zero overhead when disabled):
if (isLoggingEnabled()) {  // Check first (inline, fast)
  logStructured("Thinking Delta", {
    thinking: reasoningText,  // Object only created if logging enabled
    blockIndex: reasoningBlockIndex
  });  // Function only called if logging enabled
}
```

### Verification
- No more typing lag in Claude Code when claudish running
- Zero CPU overhead from logging when `--debug` not used
- Debug mode still works perfectly when `--debug` flag is passed
- All logs still captured completely in debug mode

---

## [1.1.2] - 2025-11-11

### Changed
- **Confirmed: No log files by default** - Logging only happens when `--debug` flag is explicitly passed
- Dev scripts cleaned up: `dev:grok` no longer enables debug mode by default
- Added `dev:grok:debug` for when debug logging is needed
- Added `npm run kill-all` command to cleanup stale claudish processes

### Fixed
- Documentation clarified: Debug mode is opt-in only, no performance overhead without `--debug`

### Notes
- **Performance tip**: If experiencing lag, check for multiple claudish processes with `ps aux | grep claudish`
- Use `npm run kill-all` to cleanup before starting new session
- Debug mode creates log files which adds overhead - only use when troubleshooting

---

## [1.1.1] - 2025-11-11

### Fixed
- 🔥 **CRITICAL PERFORMANCE FIX**: Async buffered logging eliminates UI lag
  - Claude Code no longer laggy when claudish running
  - Typing responsive, no missing letters
  - Root cause: Synchronous `appendFileSync()` was blocking event loop
  - Solution: Buffered async writes with 100ms flush interval
  - **1000x fewer disk operations** (868 → ~9 writes per session)
  - Zero event loop blocking (100% async)
  - See [PERFORMANCE_FIX.md](./PERFORMANCE_FIX.md) for technical details

### Added
- `--version` flag to show version number
- Async buffered logging system with automatic flush

### Changed
- **Default behavior**: `claudish` with no args now defaults to interactive mode
- **Model selector**: Only shows in interactive mode (not when providing prompt directly)
- Help documentation updated with new usage patterns

### Technical Details
- Logging now uses in-memory buffer (50 messages or 100ms batches)
- `appendFile()` (async) instead of `appendFileSync()` (blocking)
- Periodic flush every 100ms or when buffer exceeds 50 messages
- Process exit handler ensures no logs lost
- Build size: 59.82 KB (was 59.41 KB)

---

- **V2 Protocol Fix** - Critical compliance with Anthropic Messages API event ordering
  - `content_block_start` sent immediately after `message_start` (required by protocol)
  - Proper `ping` event timing (after content_block_start, not before)
  - Smart block management for reasoning-first models (Grok, o1)
  - Handles transition from empty initial block to thinking block seamlessly
- **Debug Logging** - Enhanced SSE event tracking for verification
  - Log critical events: message_start, content_block_start, content_block_stop, message_stop

  - [THINKING_BLOCKS_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./THINKING_BLOCKS_IMPLEMENTATION.md) - Implementation summary (660 lines)
  - [COMPREHENSIVE_UX_ISSUE_ANALYSIS.md](./COMPREHENSIVE_UX_ISSUE_ANALYSIS.md) - Technical analysis (1,400 lines)
  - [V2_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md](./V2_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md) - Quick reference guide (300 lines)
  - [RUNNING_INDICATORS_INVESTIGATION.md](./RUNNING_INDICATORS_INVESTIGATION.md) - Claude Code UI limitation analysis (400 lines)

### Changed
- **Package name**: `@madappgang/claudish` → `claudish` for better discoverability
- **Installation**: Now available via `npm install -g claudish`
- **Documentation**: Added npm installation as Option 1 (recommended) in README

### Fixed
- ✅ **10 Critical UX Issues** resolved:
  1. Reasoning content no longer visible as regular text
  2. Thinking blocks properly structured with correct indices
  3. Using `thinking_delta` (not `text_delta`) for reasoning
  4. Proper block transitions (thinking → text)
  5. Adapter design supports separated reasoning/content
  6. Event sequence compliance with Anthropic protocol
  7. Message headers now display correctly in Claude Code UI
  8. Incremental message updates (not "all at once")
  9. Thinking content signature field included
  10. Debug logging shows correct behavior
- **UI Headers**: Message headers now display correctly in Claude Code UI
- **Thinking Collapsed**: Thinking content properly hidden/collapsible
- **Protocol Compliance**: Strict event ordering per Anthropic Messages API spec
- **Smooth Streaming**: Incremental updates instead of batched

### Technical Details
- **Models with Thinking Support:**
  - `x-ai/grok-code-fast-1` (Grok with reasoning)
  - `openai/gpt-5-codex` (Codex with reasoning)
  - `openai/o1-preview` (OpenAI o1 full reasoning)
  - `openai/o1-mini` (OpenAI o1 compact)
- **Event Sequence for Reasoning Models:**
  ```
  message_start
  → content_block_start (text, index=0)  [immediate, required]
  → ping
  → [if reasoning arrives]
    - content_block_stop (index=0)       [close empty initial block]
    - content_block_start (thinking, index=1)
    - thinking_delta × N
    - content_block_stop (index=1)
  → content_block_start (text, index=2)
  → text_delta × M
  → content_block_stop (index=2)
  → message_stop
  ```
- **Backward Compatible**: Works with all existing models (non-reasoning models unaffected)
- **Build Size**: 59.0 KB

### Known Issues
- **Claude Code UI Limitation**: May not show running indicators during extremely long thinking periods (9+ minutes)
  - This is a Claude Code UI limitation with handling multiple concurrent streams, NOT a Claudish bug
  - Thinking is still happening correctly (verified in debug logs)
  - Models work perfectly, functionality unaffected (cosmetic UI issue only)

  - Override with `--quiet` or `--verbose` flags
  - Perfect for piping output to other tools
  - Redirect to files without log contamination

- ✅ **JSON Output Mode** - Structured data for tool integration
  - New `--json` flag enables Claude Code's JSON output
  - Always runs in quiet mode (no log pollution)

  - Perfect for automation, scripting, and cost tracking
  - Easy parsing with `jq` or other JSON tools

### Changed
- Build size: ~46 KB (minified)
- Enhanced CLI with new flags: `--quiet`, `--verbose`, `--json`
- Updated help documentation with output mode examples

### Examples
```bash
# Quiet mode (default) - clean output
claudish "what is 3+4?"

# Verbose mode - show logs
claudish --verbose "analyze code"

# JSON output - structured data
claudish --json "list 3 colors" | jq '.result'

# Track costs
claudish --json "task" | jq '{result, cost: .total_cost_usd}'
```

### Use Cases
- CI/CD pipelines
- Automated scripts
- Tool integration
- Cost tracking

## [1.0.8] - 2024-11-10

### Fixed
- ✅ **CRITICAL**: Fixed model identity role-playing issue
  - Non-Claude models (Grok, GPT, etc.) now correctly identify themselves
  - Added comprehensive system prompt filtering to remove Claude identity claims
  - Filters Claude-specific prompts: "You are Claude", "powered by Sonnet/Haiku/Opus", etc.
  - Added explicit identity override instruction to prevent role-playing
  - Removes `<claude_background_info>` tags that contain misleading model information
  - **Before**: Grok responded "I am Claude, created by Anthropic"
  - **After**: Grok responds "I am Grok, an AI model built by xAI"

### Technical Details
- System prompt filtering in `src/api-translator.ts`:
  - Replaces "You are Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI" → "This is Claude Code, an AI-powered CLI tool"
  - Replaces "You are powered by the model named X" → "You are powered by an AI model"
  - Removes `<claude_background_info>` XML tags
  - Adds explicit instruction: "You are NOT Claude. You are NOT created by Anthropic."
- Build size: 19.43 KB

### Changed
- Enhanced API translation to preserve model identity while maintaining Claude Code functionality
- Models now truthfully identify themselves while still having access to all Claude Code tools

## [1.0.7] - 2024-11-10

  - Perfect for clean interactive sessions

### Changed
- `dev:grok` script now includes `--debug` by default
- Build size: 17.68 KB

### Usage
```bash
# Clean console with all logs in file
bun run dev:grok

# Or manually
claudish -i -d --model x-ai/grok-code-fast-1
```

## [1.0.6] - 2024-11-10

### Added

  - Perfect for debugging model routing issues

### Changed
- Build size: 17.68 KB
- Improved debugging capabilities
- Added `logs/` to `.gitignore`

### Usage
```bash
# Enable debug logging
claudish --debug --model x-ai/grok-code-fast-1 "your prompt"

### Fixed
- ✅ Fixed proxy timeout error: "request timed out after 10 seconds"
  - Added `idleTimeout: 255` (4.25 minutes, Bun maximum) to server configuration
  - Prevents timeout during long streaming responses
  - Ensures proxy can handle Claude Code requests without timing out
- ✅ Implemented `/v1/messages/count_tokens` endpoint

- ✅ Permissions are skipped by default for autonomous operation
- ✅ Use `--no-auto-approve` to enable permission prompts
- ✅ Use valid-looking Anthropic API key format to avoid Claude Code prompts
  - Claude Code no longer prompts about "custom API key"
  - Proxy still handles actual auth with OpenRouter

### Changed
- Updated help text to reflect correct flag usage
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY now uses `sk-ant-api03-...` format (placeholder, proxy handles auth)
- Build size: 14.86 KB
