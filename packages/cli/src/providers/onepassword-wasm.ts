/**
 * On-demand 1Password WASM provisioning for COMPILED claudish binaries.
 *
 * The `@1password/sdk` depends on `@1password/sdk-core`, whose `nodejs/core.js`
 * loads its WebAssembly with `readFileSync(join(__dirname, 'core_bg.wasm'))`.
 * `bun build --compile` bundles that loader but rewrites `__dirname` to the
 * BUILD MACHINE's absolute path (e.g. `/home/runner/work/claudish/...`). At
 * runtime on a user's machine that path does not exist, so the SDK import dies
 * with `ENOENT: ... core_bg.wasm`. npm-installed users are unaffected — their
 * real `node_modules` copy is right where the loader expects it.
 *
 * Fix: BEFORE the SDK is dynamically imported, install a one-time intercept on
 * `fs.readFileSync` that catches any read of `core_bg.wasm` and serves it from
 * a local cache (`~/.claudish/cache/1password/core_bg.wasm`). If the cache is
 * cold AND the loader's own path is missing (the compiled-binary case), we
 * download the exact pinned `@1password/sdk-core` tarball from the OFFICIAL npm
 * registry, verify its SHA-512 against the pinned integrity, extract the single
 * `core_bg.wasm`, and populate the cache. ~10MB, fetched at most once per
 * machine; a non-1Password user never reaches this code at all.
 *
 * Dependency-light by contract (this module is reachable from the
 * dependency-light onepassword.ts): node built-ins ONLY (fs, os, path, zlib,
 * crypto, module, https via fetch). No new package dependency.
 *
 * PIN SYNC: SDK_CORE_VERSION / SDK_CORE_INTEGRITY must match the
 * `@1password/sdk-core` that `@1password/sdk` (in package.json) resolves to.
 * On an SDK bump, refresh both — `npm view @1password/sdk-core@<v> dist.integrity`.
