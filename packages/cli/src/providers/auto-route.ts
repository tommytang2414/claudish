/**
 * Lightweight provider-prefix tables.
 *
 * After commit 5 of the model-catalog and routing redesign, this file is no
 * longer the home of the routing chain logic — that lives in
 * `providers/routing-rules.ts` (`route()`) and ships defaults via
 * `providers/default-routing-rules.ts`. What remains here are the two derived
 * lookup tables (canonical name → shortest @ prefix, canonical name → display
 * name) that the routing engine still needs, plus a `FallbackRoute` type alias
 * preserved for callers that imported it from here pre-commit-5.
 *
 * Kept at the same path for import-stability across the codebase.
