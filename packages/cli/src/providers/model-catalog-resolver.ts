 * Warming is async and called once at proxy startup (fire-and-forget).
 *
 * All failures degrade to passthrough — never crash, return userInput unchanged.

 * `refreshCatalog()` returns ground truth so the launcher can make a policy
 * decision (proceed / warn / hard-fail) based on whether the fetch worked.
 *
 *  - `refreshed` — HTTP fetch returned ≥1 entries; in-memory cache replaced.
 *  - `fetch_failed` — Caches left untouched. `reason` distinguishes:
 *      - `timeout` — AbortSignal fired before response arrived.
 *      - `network` — fetch threw (DNS, connection refused, TLS, etc.).
 *      - `http_error` — response.ok was false (non-2xx status).
 *      - `empty` — body parsed but contained 0 entries.
