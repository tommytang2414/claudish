/**
 * Credential Authority — core interfaces.
 *
 * A {@link CredentialProvider} is the single authority for one catalog provider's
 * credentials. The surface is fully ASYNC — readiness and request-auth both pull
 * from 1Password on demand when env/config/oauth-file miss. There is NO sync
 * readiness oracle anymore: 1Password resolution is async, so a credential
 * decision is async too. Resolution is memoized per provider, so the first
 * await pays the SDK cost and subsequent reads are free.
 *
 *  - `isAvailable()` — ASYNC readiness: env var set? config key? oauth file on
 *    disk? local provider enabled? op:// resolvable? Never throws (a 1Password
 *    auth failure resolves to `false`, it does not bring down the caller).
 *  - `getRequestAuth()` — ASYNC, produces the rich artifact (headers, optional
 *    endpoint override, optional payload transform) for an outgoing request.
 *    OAuth token refreshes and op:// pulls happen here, internally.
 *  - `invalidate()` — drop any memoized resolution (after a TUI hydrate-on-add).
