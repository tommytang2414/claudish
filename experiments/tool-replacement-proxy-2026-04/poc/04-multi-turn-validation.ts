/**
 * PoC Phase 2c: Multi-turn round-trip validation
 *
 * Per the Anthropic advisor docs, clients MUST pass advisor_tool_result
 * blocks back verbatim on subsequent turns, or the API returns a
 * 400 invalid_request_error.
 *
 * This test simulates a two-turn conversation:
 *   Turn 1: user question → proxy fabricates advisor response
 *   Turn 2: user follow-up (with turn-1 advisor blocks in history)
 *           → proxy fabricates another response
 *
 * If the Anthropic SDK can:
 *   (a) round-trip advisor_tool_result blocks back through .content,
 *   (b) send them as input on turn 2 without validation errors,
 *   (c) receive a valid turn-2 response,
 * then our proxy can support multi-turn conversations.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run 02-mock-advisor-proxy.ts &
 *   bun run 04-multi-turn-validation.ts
